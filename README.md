# Unit 1

## What This Does

For this I picked the City Guides corpus, which covers nine towns. This system takes all of the travel guides' information, and makes it searchable. This system answers questions related to visiting, traveling, eating, and things to look out for in and around these towns.

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** Variable, based on .md headings

**Overlap:** None

The city_guides markdown documents are long guides centered on a main topic,
then separated into focused aspects using headings. Useful information is
spread around across the paragraph (or more) that falls under a heading.
An arbitrary character count is sure to cross-contaminate the foci,
so I decided to use the document's structure to break it into chunks.

Going with chunking by heading section and no overlap for now to keep content
focused. If an issue arises where some chunks contain too much noise, 
I can implement a sliding window approach to divide those large chunks
into smaller ones, or even into paragraph-based chunks if appropriate.

<!-- Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `guide_accessibility.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `guide_corry_vale.md#6` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
When to go

May to September. Outside those months the pub in the third village closes, the farm shop reduces its hours, and several footpaths become genuinely boggy rather than merely wet. The road is not gritted above the second village and is impassable in snow.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#3` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Eat and drink

A tearoom attached to the mill, open 10 to 4 daily except Tuesdays, which sells bread made from the flour ground twenty metres away and is the reason most people come. One pub, food served lunchtimes and Thursday to Saturday evenings.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `guide_kestrelford.md#6` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
When to go

Late spring and early autumn. The Saturday market runs year-round but is much reduced from November to February. August is busy with walkers. The single-track approach road is genuinely difficult in snow and the town can be cut off for a day or two most winters.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `guide_regional_transport.md#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
The railway

The line runs along the river valley, connecting Brightwater to the regional
hub in 50 minutes. Eleven services a day on weekdays, six on Sundays. The line
north of Brightwater closed in 1963 and everything beyond it is bus or car.

Tickets are cheaper booked the day before than on the day, and considerably
cheaper than that booked a week ahead. There is no ticket office at
Brightwater station outside weekday mornings; the machine on the platform takes
cards only.
```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** What is there to see in Pellew Sands?

**Answer:**

```
In Pellew Sands, there is a two-mile beach of hard sand (excellent at low tide and unremarkable at high), municipal gardens behind the seafront, and the surviving half of an 1890s pier that is open and free. 

Source: `guide_pellew_sands.md`

Sources retrieved: guide_accessibility.md, guide_eating.md, guide_elder_ness.md, guide_pellew_sands.md
```

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.65

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| Where can I get something to eat and drink in Brightwater? | Yes  | 0.547 |
| Where can I stay while visiting Marchwood? | Yes | 0.457 |
| What is there to see in Pellew Sands? | Yes | 0.317 |
| What should I look out for when traveling by bus? | Yes | 0.617 |
| How can I get around Kestrelford? | Yes | 0.338 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.767 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.889 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.906 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.838 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.852 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.** I asked Claude to give me feedback on my acceptance criteria. How they would be tested with only the sentence itself, would two different people score them the same way, and what would have to happen for them to fail. I was able to use the feedback that some of my criteria were vague, and adjust them to be unambiguous.

**2.** I asked Claude to look at my split_documents() implementation, for errors and edge cases. One case, was that my initial function using `chunk_start = doc.text.find("#")` would break if it received a .md file with no headings. The other, was if a heading marker had no non-alphanumeric characters after it to the document end, I would get an out of range IndexError from: 

```
while not doc.text[chunk_start].isalnum():
    chunk_start += 1
```

I hardened the implementation to fix these potential issues. Neither of these would occur from the corpus version used currently, but the system is now more resilent in case more .md documents are added to it.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
